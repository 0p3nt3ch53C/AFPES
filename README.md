# Alliance For Peacebuilding - Eirene Simplification

A project written to help support the Alliance For Peacebuilding's Eirene
Database efforts, with simplification of data querying/parsing.

## Alliance For Peacebuilding

## Eirene Simplification

In a project to simplify and parse data from Eirene, some in the project found
the dataset to be large, and difficult to navigate for specific information. In
order to support one use case to resolve this, the AFPES (Alliance For
Peacebuilding - Eirene Simplification) application has been developed. This
project (and further, application) have been written to make the data more
parsable and queryable as a csv, based on select fields (and tables) from the
Eirene Excel spreadsheet (mentioned above).

This application is has no affiliation, support of, or legal connection to AFP
or any other legal entity.

### AFPES Use Case

### AFPES Data Export

The data processed in AFPES is exported as a CSV file (NOTE: Data from AFP
Eirene that contained commas, will be stripped as part of processing). The
format will look similar to this:

### AFPES Example Run

When attempting to run AFPES, use the following as parameters / arguments:


#### --AFPE

```"--AFPE"```:
This tells AFPES where the file for the Eirene database (Excel file) is located. By default (unless specified) AFPES will assume the filename and location is in the same directory AFPES is running from, and is named 'EAFP.xlsx'.

In example: ```--AFPE "AfP_EirenePeacebuildingDatabase_2.2020.xlsx"```

Full example (Windows): ```.\AFPES.exe --AFPE "AfP_EirenePeacebuildingDatabase_2.2020.xlsx"```


#### --Export

```"--Export"```:
This tells AFPES where the exported data (in CSV format) should go. By default (unless specified) AFPES will write a file to the same filename and location in the same directory AFPES is running from, named "Eirene Peacebuilding Database Subgroups MM-DD-YYYY HHMMSS.csv". Timestamp (MM-DD-YYYY HHMMSS) follows the format here: first MM = two digit month, DD = two digit day, YYYY = four digit year(s), HH two digit hour(s) (based on 24 hour clock, not 12hour clock), second MM = two digit minute(s), SS = two digit second(s).

In example: ```--Export "Log.csv"```

Full example (Windows)*: ```AFPES.exe --AFPE "AfP_EirenePeacebuildingDatabase_2.2020.xlsx" --Export "Log.csv"```
* Builds off of previous example explained in "--AFPE".


#### None

AFPES can be run with no arguments, provided you follow the defaults in the above arguments direction. Based on the arguments above, if you simply have a file "EAFP.xlsx" in the same directory as the AFPES application, you can run this application without any arguments, and we should expect to see an additional file (e.g., "Eirene Peacebuilding Database Subgroups 11-01-2024 170954.csv") when AFPES is completed.

Example: ```AFPES.exe```
